WeeklyScheduler
Anton Kovalyov

I included a screenshot of the output (Capture).
For this project I implemented the tableView 
(I found some videos on youtube on how to do 
it, since it wasn't covered in the book).
In the project folder you can find 7 classes.
The names are:

1. CourseDetails.
2. MyDetails (contains my course details, which are
   used to test the project).
3. PersonalInfo.
4. Table (creates a two dimensional array used for 
   the Weekly Scheduler table).
5. TableRows (a class that returns a row object used 
   for the GUI).
6. WeeklySchedulerOut (not really related to this 
   project but I still included it, this class is to
   print the table in the Netbeans output window and
   in a file).
7. WeeklySchedulerTab (the GUI).
